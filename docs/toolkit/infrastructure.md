# Infrastructure

The AI Developer Toolkit provides comprehensive infrastructure templates to help you deploy your AI applications to various environments. These templates are designed to be modular, customizable, and follow infrastructure as code best practices.

## Terraform Templates

The toolkit includes Terraform modules for deploying AI applications to major cloud providers:

### AWS Templates

**Features:**
- ECS Fargate for containerized deployments
- Lambda functions for serverless AI endpoints
- SageMaker for model hosting
- RDS for managed databases
- OpenSearch for vector search
- S3 for storage
- API Gateway for API management
- CloudFront for content delivery
- Cognito for authentication

**Usage:**
```bash
task infra:create:aws -- my-project
```

### Azure Templates

**Features:**
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Functions
- Azure OpenAI Service integration
- Azure Database services
- Azure Cognitive Search for vector search
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure API Management
- Azure AD for authentication

**Usage:**
```bash
task infra:create:azure -- my-project
```

### GCP Templates

**Features:**
- Google Cloud Run
- Cloud Functions
- Vertex AI integration
- Cloud SQL
- Vector Search
- Cloud Storage
- API Gateway
- Firebase Authentication

**Usage:**
```bash
task infra:create:gcp -- my-project
```

## Docker Compose Templates

The toolkit provides Docker Compose templates for local development and production-like environments:

### Development Environment

A comprehensive development environment with all necessary services:

**Features:**
- Frontend development server with hot reloading
- Backend API services
- Database services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Local AI services (optional)
- Monitoring tools
- Mailhog for email testing
- Traefik for routing

**Usage:**
```bash
task docker:create:dev -- my-project
```

### Production-like Environment

A production-like environment for testing:

**Features:**
- Optimized builds for frontend and backend
- Database services
- Redis for caching
- Nginx for static assets
- Traefik for routing and SSL
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Logging with ELK stack

**Usage:**
```bash
task docker:create:prod -- my-project
```

### Database Services

Standalone database services that can be added to any project:

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL with vector extensions
task docker:add:postgres -- my-project

# Add MongoDB with vector search
task docker:add:mongodb -- my-project

# Add Redis with vector search
task docker:add:redis -- my-project
```

## Kubernetes Templates

Basic Kubernetes manifests for containerized deployments:

**Features:**
- Deployment templates
- Service definitions
- Ingress configurations
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Persistent Volume claims
- Helm charts

**Usage:**
```bash
task k8s:create -- my-project
```

## Infrastructure Management

The toolkit provides tasks for managing your infrastructure:

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
task terraform:init -- my-project

# Plan Terraform changes
task terraform:plan -- my-project

# Apply Terraform changes
task terraform:apply -- my-project

# Destroy infrastructure
task terraform:destroy -- my-project
```

## Custom Infrastructure Templates

You can customize infrastructure templates during creation:

```bash
# Create AWS infrastructure with specific options
task infra:create:aws -- my-project --region=us-west-2 --vpc=existing --db=postgres
```
